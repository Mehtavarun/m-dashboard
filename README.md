# 🧭 Home Dashboard

The landing page for the Home Platform. It serves as a static directory to access all local microservices.

**Built With:** HTML5, CSS3, Nginx (Alpine).

## ⚡ Features
* **Zero-Overhead:** Served via a tiny Nginx container named `dashboard`.
* **Live Health Checks:** Javascript fetches app status in the background to show Green/Red indicators.
* **Dark Mode:** Minimalist CSS design.

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding a New Link
Open `index.html` and add a new card to the grid:

```html
<a href="https://new-app.mehta.local" class="card">
    <div id="status-new" class="status-dot"></div>
    <h3>🚀 New App</h3>
    <p>Description here</p>
</a>
```

### Updating Health Checks
Add your new service URL to the `runChecks()` function in the script section of `index.html`:

```javascript
checkHealth('https://new-app.mehta.local', 'status-new');
```

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

This repo is built automatically by the `gateway` compose file.
To build it manually:

```bash
docker build -t dashboard .
docker run --name dashboard -p 8080:80 dashboard
```

In case the status light never turns green you probably need to trust the certificate generated by caddy. I used below to command to copy the certificate from docker container and trust it in the system.

```
 docker cp gateway:/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt ./homelab-root.crt
```

```
Locate the file homelab-root.crt in Finder (it should be in your current folder).

Double-click it. This will open Keychain Access.

It might ask which keychain to add it to. Choose System (or "login" if System isn't an option).

Find the certificate named "Caddy Local Authority" in the list.

Double-click it to open settings.

Expand the Trust section.

Change "When using this certificate" to Always Trust.

Close the window (you will need to enter your Mac password/TouchID).
